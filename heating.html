	<h1>CONTROL YOUR HEATING FROM ANYWHERE WITHOUT INTERNET OR WIFI</h1>
		<p><strong>Ideal for controlling heat in a holiday home which doesn't 
		have wifi.</strong></p>
		<p lang="en-US">&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>There are many devices available for controlling your central 
		heating. They mostly depend on having WiFi and complicated apps. They 
		are also very expensive, hundreds of $, € or £.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Google Nest Thermostat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $239</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Hive Active Heating Kit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; €199</strong></p>
		<p><strong></strong></p>
		<p><strong>Many of them require that you pay an annual fee for the use of their 
		app. To be fair, some of them are very sophisticated and you can control 
		the temperature you want your home to be at and some have a "learning" 
		function. </strong> </p>
		<p><strong>However, for the vast majority of users they are far too complex and 
		far more complicated than they need to be.</strong></p>
		<p>I<span class="auto-style3"><strong>f you are one of the vast majority 
		who just wants to make a simple unanswered and FREE call to turn on your 
		Heating or Air Conditioning then our Module will do it easily</strong></span><strong> and without any 
		need for Wifi, complicated apps or recurring charges.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>We can only give you a very rough idea of how to use our Module to control your 
		Central Heating (CH) or Hot Water (HW) or (AC) because of the variety of such systems but it is mostly 
		very straightforward and your electrician should be able to do it in 
		well under and hour. 
		</strong></p>
		<p class="auto-style4"><strong>WARNING: If you connect electrical 
		equipment to the RF socket which is controlled by our Module make sure 
		it is inspected and certified by a qualified Electrician. It may be 
		illegal to do electrical work yourself if you are unqualified and may 
		invalidate property or life insurance in the event of an accident or 
		damage. Be careful, ELECTRICITY CAN KILL!!!</strong></p>
		<p class="auto-style4"><strong>JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING WORKS, DOESN'T 
		MEAN IT'SAFE!!!</strong></p>
		<p class="auto-style3"><strong>CONTROL VIA THE CENTRAL HEATING PROGRAMMER (MOSTLY UK &amp; 
		EUROPE)</strong></p>
		<p><strong>There are useful Central Heating diagrams on this very informative </strong>
		<a href="https://www.flameport.com/electric/central_heating/combination_boilers_programmer.cs4">
		<strong>site</strong></a> <strong>which pertain mostly to the UK and 
		Europe.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Most heating systems work on 220v/110v (UK and Europe) but 
		some control with 24V AC (USA). What we are describing below is for 220V systems 
		and involves controlling the HW and CH via the Programmer terminals. You 
		can also control your HW and CH and AC via the THERMOSTAT as well which 
		we will mention below.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Your existing 
		Programmer basically makes a terminal 
		or terminals become LIVE. Our Module can do the same thing. </strong></p>
		<p><strong>If you want to try to control the heating yourself and have 
		an electrician or other suitably qualified person sign off on the work 
		for you, you need to do the following:</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Firstly turn off the power to the central heating at the 
		fused spur to the Programmer. Remove 
		the fuse to be extra safe. </strong></p>
		<p><strong>Remove the existing Programmer from the Universal Back Plate. 
		It looks something like this if you have a dual programmer controlling 
		Central Heating (CH) and Hot Water (HW). You will usually see the following 
		terminals: N, L, 1, 2, 3, 4. </strong></p>
		<p>
		<img alt="https://www.turnitonfromanywhere.com" src="images/universal%20backplate.JPG" style="width: 177px; height: 188px" /><img alt="https://www.turnitonfromanywhere.com" src="images/dual%20backplate.png" style="width: 356px; height: 213px" /></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>On the back of the Programmer you will usually see a diagram 
		showing how the connections are made. The diagram above is for a dual 
		Programmer which is for Central Heating (CH) and Hot Water (HW). What 
		the Programmer does is connect a Live or line voltage to terminal 3 for 
		Hot Water ON and connects terminal 4 to Live or line voltage to terminal 
		4 for Central Heating ON.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Study the various diagrams in the link to the
		<a href="https://www.flameport.com/electric/central_heating/index.cs4">
		https://www.flameport.com/electric/central_heating/index.cs4</a> site mentioned 
		above to see how your system operates.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>You may have just a single channel Programmer. The diagram you have on 
		your Programmer may look something like this:</strong></p>
		<p>
		<img alt="https://www.turnitonfromanywhere.com" src="images/single%20channel%20diag.png" style="width: 550px; height: 414px" /></p>
		<p><strong>To turn the heat on for this boiler all you have to do is 
		make terminal 4 live.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>So to control these boilers all we need to do is usually make 
		terminal 3 or 4&nbsp; or 3 and 4 live. To do that we need to attach a 
		double plug socket to the 3 Amp Fused Spur. We then insert our RF plug 
		or plugs into 
		this socket. We can now control our RF socket in the usual way by 
		sending it signals from our Module turning it ON or OFF. We then simply 
		insert a plug with 3 core cable into our RF plug. So now when our module 
		sends a signal to the RF plug the cable attached to the plug becomes 
		Live. </strong> </p>
		<p><strong>We simply connect this cable's live wire only to either terminal 3 or 4 depending on 
		whether we want o control the CH or HW. You don't need to use the 
		neutral wire.To be able to control both you 
		will of course need two RF sockets. You can control the sockets in any 
		of the 3 Configurations but if you use Configuration No.1 you will need 
		to purchase two Modules if you want to control BOTH CH and HW. Most 
		people just want to control the CH remotely so one Modue is sufficient. 
		If you have a Combi Boiler only one of our Modules is needed.Please see the diagrams 
		in the
		<a href="https://www.flameport.com/electric/central_heating/index.cs4">
		web site</a> mentioned earlier.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>It sounds more complicated than it is. Hopefully this picture 
		will make it more clear. This is for an
		<a href="https://www.flameport.com/electric/central_heating/heating_wiring_S_plan.cs4">
		S-Plan</a> setup.</strong></p>
		<p>
		<img alt="htts://www.turnitonfromanywhere.com" src="images/wired5.png" style="width: 700px; height: 253px" /></p>
		<p><strong>If you have a 
		<a href="https://www.flameport.com/electric/central_heating/heating_wiring_Y_plan.cs4">Y-Plan 
		Central Heating</a> setup you will not be 
		able to control the Hot Water (HW) so easily. This is because this 
		system requires a Live to terminal 1 when it is OFF. You can get over 
		this by adding a relay to your circuit which will switch the Live from 
		terminal 1 to terminal 2 when there is a call for HW. Ask your 
		Electrician or Heating Engineer.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Some people like to operate the Programmer in parallel with 
		our Module. Be aware that if you do that and if either terminal 3 or 4 
		is made Live by the Programmer then if you pull either of the plugs from 
		the RF socket that the Live prong of the plug could be Live and if 
		anybody touched it they would be electrocuted! Some people Super Glue 
		the plugs in place to avoid this and also clearly label the plugs as 
		being potentially Live.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>It's probably safer to remove the Programmer and cover the 
		electrical connections to the terminals with a suitable enclosure. Your 
		Electrician or Heating Engineer will advise.</strong></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="auto-style3"><strong>CONTROL VIA THE THERMOSTAT (USA MOSTLY, 
		BUT CAN ALSO BE USED IN UK AND EUROPE)</strong></p>
		<p><strong>CH and HW and AC are mostly controlled in the US using 24V 
		AC. There are many variations of systems available but they mostly 
		involve connecting a 24V AC Live wire to other wires to activate the CH, 
		HW or AC. These systems can be controlled quite easily by inserting 110V 
		AC relays (coil voltage) in series with the wires going to the CH, HW 
		and AC. (In Europe and UK you would of course use 220V AC coils for your 
		relays).</strong></p>
		<p><strong>These relays are then energised by a plug coming from the RF 
		plug which is in turn controlled by our Module.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Again, it's very important to stress that all electrical work 
		should be certified or signed off by a qualified Electrician or Heating 
		Engineer. </strong></p>
